⛑Java dosent support multiple inheritance so , for that we use interfaces.
 Every variable must be static final
 By default methods declared here are abstract(only method signature and return type not the body).

⛑That means all the methods in an interface are declared with
 an empty body and are public and all fields are public, static, and final by default.

⛑Interface tell us WHAT TO DO  not HOW TO DO.

Syntax -

public interface Name_1 {
    static final int variable_1;

    void method1();
    void method2();

}

public interface Name_2 {
    static final int variable_1;

    void method1();
    void method2();

}

public class ChildClass implements Name_1, Name_2 {
    @Override
    void mehtod1{
        System.out.println("method 1 of child class is printed"
    }
    @Override
    void method2{
         System.out.println("method 1 of child class is printed"
    }
}

// ❌❌ ******** NOTE -> the overridden methods in child class should have accesss
//                  modifier with less restriction than the one from which it has been overriding. ❌❌
